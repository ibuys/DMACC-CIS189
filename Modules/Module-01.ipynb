    "### Compiled Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage.\n",

    "It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, \n",
    "but instead, read and executed by some other program (i.e. the Python interpreter).\n",

    "Python is a dynamically typed language. What does that mean? Unlike statically types languages, it is not necessary to specify the type of a variable (string, integer, float) when it is defined. It means that the type of the variable is determined only at runtime. Also, it is possible to change the type of a variable within the same program (just because you can do this doesn't mean you should; it is generally bad programming practice to change the type of a variable within a program):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create variable name set to \"Enrico Fermi\". \n",
    "name = \"Enrico Fermi\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# At some point later in the program, set name to a list of integers.\n",
    "# Valid Python!\n",
    "name = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A very useful function in Python is `type`. It lets you know the data type of the variable you pass to it. \n",
    "Let's modify our porgram to print the type of `name` when it was initially defined and after we changed it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create variable name set to \"Enrico Fermi\". \n",
    "name = \"Enrico Fermi\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"type(name) initially: {type(name)}\")\n",

    "# At some point later in the program, set name to a list of integers.\n",
    "# Valid Python!\n",
    "name = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n",

    "Variable names are case-sensitive. The convention in Python is to use lowercase characters with words separated by underscores (sometimes referred to as [\"snake case\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)), and title case for class definitions. You are free to name your variables as you wish, but snake case should be preferred. Here are a few examples of variable names that adhere to the snake case convention and others that do not:\n",

    "Docstrings are used to provide information about a function or a class. They are specified at the time the function is created, and should help the user understand the purpose of the function (or class). Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes. Here's an example:\n",
